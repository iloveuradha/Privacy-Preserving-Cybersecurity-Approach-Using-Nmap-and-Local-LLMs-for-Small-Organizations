#This repository hosts the research paper LocalAI-Sec, which introduces a practical, low-cost, privacy-preserving cybersecurity framework tailored for SMBs (Small and Medium Businesses).

The paper demonstrates how combining:

Nmap (network scanning)

NVD (real-time CVE enrichment)

Local LLMs (Ollama + Llama3)

Human-in-the-loop decision making

can give small organizations enterprise-grade security analysis without paid APIs or cloud services.
